# Personal Website

"Welcome to my personal website repository! 

This project is a blog-style website built using the Spring framework. The aim of this website is to showcase my personal thoughts, experiences, and interests. The back-end is built using the Spring framework, which provides a powerful and flexible platform for web development.

The goal of this project is to showcase my abilities as a self-taught programmer by creating a clean and well-structured code base.

I started from the basics such as CRUD operations and go beyond, covering advanced topics such as: Security (JWT Oauth2), file uploads, email sending, caching, HATEOAS, documentation with Swagger, integration testing, JPA projections, DDD, Domain Events, Oauth2 security, database migration and versioning (Flyway), and much more! The REST API was developed using Spring Boot and follows the best practices in the industry for Spring REST specialists.

In the future, I plan to add a front-end using the Angular framework, which will enhance the user experience and make the website more interactive. This repository is a work in progress, so stay tuned for updates and improvements!

Whether you are a fellow programmer or just curious about my work, feel free to explore and contribute to the development of this project.‚Äù
