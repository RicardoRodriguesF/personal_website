# personal_website

"Welcome to my personal website repository! 

This project is a blog-style website built using the Spring framework. The aim of this website is to showcase my personal thoughts, experiences, and interests. The back-end is built using the Spring framework, which provides a powerful and flexible platform for web development.

The goal of this project is to showcase my abilities as a self-taught programmer by creating a clean and well-structured code base.

 In the future, I plan to add a front-end using the Angular framework, which will enhance the user experience and make the website more interactive. This repository is a work in progress, so stay tuned for updates and improvements!

Whether you are a fellow programmer or just curious about my work, feel free to explore and contribute to the development of this project.‚Äù
